# PD-EEG: Resting-State & Walking EEG in Parkinson's Disease

## Overview

This dataset contains EEG recordings from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC), collected under two behavioral conditions: resting state (sitting) and walking. The dataset was acquired at the Neurology Institute, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

## Participants

- **Parkinson’s disease (PD):** 116 participants
- **Healthy controls (HC):** 28 participants

### Inclusion criteria (PD):
- Age 40–90  
- Hoehn & Yahr stage ≤ 3 
- MoCA ≥ 21  
- Able to walk independently  

### Exclusion criteria:
- History of stroke or major neurological disorder  
- Brain surgery  
- Significant head injury  
- Inability to walk independently  

All participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

## Experimental Design

Each participant underwent EEG recording under two conditions:

1. **Resting State** (144 Recordings)
   - Sitting
   - Eyes open
   - Duration: ~4 minutes  

2. **Walking** (133 Recordings)
   - Walking on a treadmill at a comfortable speed while holding the handrails.
   - Duration: ~4 minutes  

Additional clinical data were collected, including:

- **Demographic data**
- **LEDD** (Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose) - a measure of anti-parkinsonian medication dosage.
- **MoCA** (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) - a global measure of cognitive function.  
- **MDS-UPDRS**  - Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - the gold standard clinical rating scale for Parkinson's Disease.
- **CTT** - Color Trails Test - a measure of executive function and processing speed.
